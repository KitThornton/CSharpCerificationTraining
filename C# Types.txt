1. Properties and fields
Properties and fields provide objects the ability to store data. Objects have properties.
Encapsulation -> 
    * Data stored inside an object should be accessible only to that object
    * Not directly publicly accessible

A Field provide the ability to store data privately only available from within the object
Properties provide the ability to R/W data to these private fields
    * They provide encapsulation for the fields
    * Data being written to / read can be verified before access granted

A field is a private variable that can only be accessed by code within the object
A property is used to provide public access to the private fields
