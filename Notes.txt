Here we'll make some notes based on the Programming in C# course we're undertaking

********* ---- Section 3 - C# Fundamentals ---- *********
1. Three pillars of OOP
Encapsulation
Grouping data and functions into a single component
Allows selective hiding of data and functionalities

Inheritance
Enables one class to reuse code from another class
A single object can possess the functionality of multiple classes
Provides ability to extend and modify behaviour

Polymorphism
The result of Encapsulation and Inheritance
The ability to provide different functionalities for same method name

2. Objects
An object is a variable containing two things:
    * The properties that were defined in the class
    * The abilities defined as methods in the class
Each object hs its own state (unique collection of data values)
